The follder architecture is based on Nx Workspace to provide a configurable workspace that can contain multiple applications in the `./apps` folder and multiple libraries in the `./packages` folder. 
This is very useful for building large scale applications with multiple components and features that can be easily maintained and updated.

- The Documentation website is stored in `./apps/docs` folder and it contains files and folders that are required to build the documentation website.

You can find demo applications in the `./apps` folder that are used to test the library and to provide examples of how to use the library in different frameworks like Angular, ReactJS or Vanilla Javascript.
