## Architecture overview

The follder architecture is based on Nx Workspace to provide a configurable workspace that can contain multiple applications in the `./apps` folder and multiple libraries in the `./packages` folder. 
This is very useful for building large scale applications with multiple components and features that can be easily maintained and updated.

| File                                      | Description                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/src/index.ts`                           | contains the main entry point of the library                          |
| `/src/lib/upload-button-ui.element.ts`    | Web Component that implement UI                                       |
