# Events management

omponent have a lot of events that you can use to hook into the component's lifecycle. You can find a list of all events on this page.

## Events types

You can handle the following events from the component:

  - `progress` - The upload progress event. The event detail is the upload progress in percentage.
  - `success` - The upload success event. The event detail is the upload result.
  - `error` - The upload error event. The event detail is the error message.

## Code example
  
```js
export function App() {
  const token = 'WEB3STORAGE_APIKEY';

  function onSuccess(e) {
    console.log(e.detail);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <div/>
      <web3-upload-btn 
        token={token}
        isdisplayresult={true}
        isdisplaytoast={true}
        onClick={onSuccess}></web3-upload-btn>
      <div />
    </>
  );
}
export default App;

```
