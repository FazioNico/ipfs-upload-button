# Events management

You can handle the following events from the component:

  - `progress` - The upload progress event. The event detail is the upload progress in percentage.
  - `success` - The upload success event. The event detail is the upload result.
  - `error` - The upload error event. The event detail is the error message.

**Example:**
  
  ```js
  const btn = document.querySelector('web3-upload-btn')
  btn.addEventListener('success', (e) => {
    console.log('Result: ', e.detail);
  });
  ```
